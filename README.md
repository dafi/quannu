# Quannu The Timer

![Quanno Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Quannu is another timer app for Mac

There are amazing Timer apps for Mac but the most useful for myself are insanely expensive, hey dude it's just a timer app!

## How to set up timers

You must type the timer expression, no beautiful but less useful time wheels, just type the text

### Absolute time

Allow to set a specific hour, minute (and second) for current day

Enter `8:10` or `16.34` or `22:00:57`

### Relative time

Allow to set a timer starting from the current time

Fire the timer in 12 minutes `12m`

You can specify hours, minutes and seconds, `3h22m4s`

## TODO List

[ ] Support multiple timers
 
[ ] Choose user sound files

[ ] Block the screen
